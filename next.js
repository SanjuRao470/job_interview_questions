//Important points for Interview--------------
//we know React is perform CSR whereas Next.js perform both SSR(pre-render pages)/SSG(pre-render html at built time)
//what kind of functionality next.js provide  to website becomes seo friendly which react can no?
//Reason behind why next.js enhance SEO beacuse 
//1-
// Summary: Why Next.js is Better for SEO?
// Feature	Next.js	                          ///React
// ✅ Server-Side Rendering (SSR)	✅ Yes	❌ No
// ✅ Static Site Generation (SSG)	✅ Yes	❌ No
// ✅ Fast Image Optimization	✅ Yes	❌ No
// ✅ SEO-Friendly URLs	✅ Yes	❌ No
// ✅ Sitemap & Robots.txt	✅ Yes	❌ No
// ✅ Built-in Meta Tags	✅ Yes	❌ No

// Final Answer for the Interviewer:
// "Next.js improves SEO because it supports SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation),
//  making content instantly accessible to search engines. Unlike React, which relies on Client-Side Rendering 
//  (CSR), Next.js pre-renders pages, improves page speed, optimizes images, and allows dynamic meta tag updates. 
// This leads to faster indexing, higher Google rankings, and better user experience, which React alone cannot achieve."
