// ✅ Indicators That You Truly Know Your Job (In Depth)

// 1. You understand the why, not just the how
// You're not just writing code to meet a ticket.

// You ask: What is the user trying to achieve? Why are we building this feature now?

// This lets you suggest smarter solutions, avoid wasted work, and build more useful products.

// Example: Instead of blindly building a form, you ask, “Who uses this? Can we autofill some data to save time for the user?”




// 2. You can break down problems into manageable parts
// You don’t panic when you see a big requirement.

// You decompose features into logical steps, estimate time, and spot dependencies.

// You don’t block others or get stuck for long because you work methodically.

// Example: You divide “build product page” into: layout → API fetch → image gallery → price logic → add-to-cart.




// 3. Your code is clean, readable, and scalable
// You follow consistent naming conventions.

// You avoid copy-paste and write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

// You organize files logically and think about others reading your code later.

// Example: Instead of a messy 500-line component, you split it into smaller, reusable pieces with clear purpose and prop types.




// 4. You ask the right questions in meetings
// You don't just sit quietly — you clarify edge cases, data flows, and user behavior.

// You identify vague or missing specs early, avoiding rework later.

// You challenge poor product decisions tactfully when needed.

// Example: “What should happen if the user submits without filling address?” or “Should this work offline too?”




// 5. You can explain your work to non-technical people
// You don’t hide behind jargon.

// You communicate clearly with designers, clients, or PMs, adapting to their level.

// You build trust by being able to translate tech into business value.

// Example: “We’re caching this API so users don’t wait every time. It’ll make checkout feel instant.”




// 6. You’re confident when debugging or under pressure
// You don’t panic when production breaks or a bug appears.

// You debug systematically — check logs, reproduce the issue, isolate causes.

// You focus on fixing, not blaming, and write postmortems if needed.

// Example: You use console.log, breakpoints, or try/catch to trace what’s happening instead of guessing blindly.




// 7. You think proactively, not reactively
// You don’t wait to be told what’s broken or slow.

// You look ahead — you optimize performance, catch security gaps, or suggest architecture improvements.

// You question whether a feature should even exist or if it can be simplified.

// Example: You notice a growing component tree and suggest introducing lazy loading or code splitting.




// 8. You can guide or mentor others
// You help onboard new devs, explain architecture, or give useful code review feedback.

// You don’t get frustrated by questions — you teach with empathy.

// You lead by example in both code and behavior.

// Example: “You’re duplicating logic here — let me show you how we can extract it into a custom hook.”




// 9. You prioritize long-term quality
// You write tests, add comments, refactor code when needed.

// You avoid tech debt unless it’s a strategic trade-off.

// You push for maintainability even under tight deadlines.

// Example: Even during a sprint crunch, you create a reusable Button instead of hardcoding UI 5 times.




// 10. You can ship features from scratch
// Given a feature, you can gather requirements, design the solution, write backend and frontend code, test it, and deploy it — independently if needed.

// You know what trade-offs are okay and when to ask for help.

// You take ownership from start to finish.

// Example: You independently build an admin dashboard: user roles, filters, API integrations, and secure deployment.
