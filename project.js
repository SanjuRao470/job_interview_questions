// When discussing a project like interviewApp using the MERN stack, Next.js, 
// and WebSocket, interview panels typically focus on :

//Squence of asking question --------

//1--end to end  ---in which domain HR domain
// high level design(overall functionality)
// low level design(detail in everything)

//2---Technology or stack
//MERN  //NEXT.JS

//3--DB Structure

//4-- sometimes they asked what to use or what to not use and why?

//5----Security based Questions

//6--- Role & Resposibility

//7---what are the challenges you faced which help you to lern more.

//8--they wants check your mind and nature (like to have helping mindset)



// General Project Questions
//IMPORTANT Question: Tell me about your experience like
// how many project you done, and which technology you have good command , which project recenty you have done

// 1-Can you give a brief overview of your project, interviewApp?

// // answer:  Be prepared to explain the purpose, key features, and overall architecture of the app.
// ANSWER---
//The project, interviewApp, is designed for the HR domain to streamline the technical
//interview process and save the company's resources. The application allows for conducting 
//technical interview rounds efficiently. It is built using Next.js and MUI (Material-UI) for the frontend, while
//the backend is developed with Node.js and Express. MongoDB is used as the database to store interview data and results.

//2- What specific problem does interviewApp solve?

// answer: Highlight the problem it addresses and how it provides a solution.
// MAIN POINTS :
 //1-only need three field : name ,email, contact number
// 2-no need to have resume we have parameter based their experienced
//3-here we do not shared candidate/client's information with interviewer
//4-interviewapp has its own coding environments
//5-we have feedback module with detailed report  is shared with client
//6-instant/immediate payment.


 //short-------
// interviewApp solves the problem of inefficient and resource-intensive
// technical interview processes. It automates and streamlines technical interviews,
// saving time and reducing workload for HR and technical teams. The app ensures
// consistency in candidate evaluation and facilitates remote interviews as well.


//3- Why did you choose the MERN stack for this project?
// answer: Discuss the benefits of using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

// for this project because it offers a powerful combination of performance, 
// scalability, and efficiency.
// as i said 
// Next.js provides server-side rendering and static site generation for improved performance 
// and SEO, along with features like Image Optimization.
// Node.js and Express deliver a robust(tangible) and flexible backend, 
// while MongoDB ensures scalable and efficient data management. 
// This stack enables rapid development and handles complex scenarios effectively


// why you choose next.js over React.js?(next.js is framework of react.js)

//because Next.js offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and folder based rounting,
//which improve performance and SEO. It also includes features like Image Optimization and API routes,
//making development faster and more efficient.

// why you choose mongodb over mysql?
// because MongoDB offers greater flexibility with its schema-less design,

//TESTING FRAMEWORKS------  jest-cucumber" & "jest-enzyme

// Testing and Quality Assurance Questions
//1- How do you test your application?
//answer: Explain your testing strategy, including the tools and frameworks used
// for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
// like Jest is a JavaScript/TypeScript testing framework and MOCHA for node.js

//When testing a web application, a variety of languages and frameworks can be used depending on the testing approach
// (unit, integration, end-to-end) 

//unit tests
// Purpose: Test individual units/components of a software in isolation (e.g., functions, methods).
// Unit tests check individual pieces of code, usually a single function or component, to make sure it works correctly.
//Example: Testing a function that adds two numbers to ensure it returns the correct result.

// // integration tests
// Purpose: Test the interaction between integrated units/components to ensure they work well together.
//Integration tests check if different pieces of code work well together. They test the interaction between multiple units
// (e.g., functions, components, services, etc.).
//Example: Testing if a function that saves data to a database correctly integrates with the database and saves the data properly.



// // and end-to-end tests
// Purpose: Test the flow of an application as a whole to ensure that the entire process of user input and output works smoothly.
//What they are: E2E tests simulate real-world scenarios where the whole system is tested from start to finish, as a user would experience it.
//Testing an e-commerce site where you add a product to the cart, check out, and receive a confirmation message,
// ensuring the full flow works.




//ANSWER
// there are three common types of testing approaches: Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-end Tests.
// I used the unit testing because unit tests are quick, reliable, and easy to maintain
// while E2E tests are often slow, brittle, and require more maintenance.


// I used the Jest: (jest-enzyme is for unit testing React components and their interactions.)
//A widely-used testing framework for unit and integration tests. It’s known for its simplicity and ability to mock functions.

//Jest is a testing framework that provides a complete testing environment,
// including test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.
//  Enzyme is a utility that works alongside Jest to provide a more intuitive API for testing React components,
// allowing for shallow, mount, and render testing.

//DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNIT TEST AND INTEGRATION TEST

//Scope:

// Unit Tests: Test individual components or functions in isolation.
// Integration Tests: Test how different components or modules work together.

// Focus:

// Unit Tests: Focus on correctness of specific logic or functionality.
// Integration Tests: Focus on the interaction between components (e.g., API calls, database).

// Speed:

// Unit Tests: Fast, as they test small parts in isolation.
// Integration Tests: Slower, due to testing across multiple parts.

// Complexity:

// Unit Tests: Simple, focus on isolated code.
// Integration Tests: More complex, involve multiple systems.

//example------------
// test('renders learn react link', () => {
//     render(<App />);
   
//   });


//EXAMPLE---------
//Jest Unit Test Case (e.g., add.test.js):
//STEPS---
//1-npm install --save-dev jest
//2- "scripts": {//ADD SCRIPT IN PACKAGE.JSON FILE
//   "test": "jest"
// }
//3- npm test --(run test case)



// add.test.js
// const add = require('./add'); // Import the add function

// test('adds 2 + 3 to equal 5', () => {
//   expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5); // Test case for adding 2 and 3
// });

// test('adds -1 + 1 to equal 0', () => {
//   expect(add(-1, 1)).toBe(0); // Test case for adding -1 and 1
// });

// test('adds 0 + 0 to equal 0', () => {
//   expect(add(0, 0)).toBe(0); // Test case for adding 0 and 0
// });


///-------- How to create Mock function

// Step 1 npm install --save-dev jest
// Step 2  You can create a mock function using jest.fn() in your test file.
// Step 3: Write the Test Code

// EXAMPLE-1 FOR BASIC MOCK FUNCTION
// // Step 3.1: Create a mock function
// const mockFunction = jest.fn();

// // Step 3.2: Call the mock function
// mockFunction();

// // Step 3.3: Assert that the function was called once
// test('Mock function is called once', () => {
//   expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
// });


// EXAMPLE -2FOR BASIC MOCK FUNCTION

// const mockFunction = jest.fn().mockImplementation((a, b) => a + b);

// // Call the mock function with arguments
// const result = mockFunction(2, 3);

// // Test the result of the function call
// expect(result).toBe(5);



// // Step 3.1: Create a mock function with a return value
// const mockFunction = jest.fn(() => 'Hello, Jest!');

// // Step 3.2: Call the mock function
// const result = mockFunction();

// // Step 3.3: Assert the return value of the mock function
// test('Mock function returns the correct value', () => {
//   expect(result).toBe('Hello, Jest!');
// });



//2- How do you ensure code quality and maintainability?

//answer: Discuss code reviews, linting, adhering to coding standards, and using version control practices.




// Problem-Solving and Optimization Questions
//1- Describe a difficult bug you encountered during development and how you resolved it.

//answer: Provide a specific example and outline the steps you took to debug and fix the issue.

//2- How do you handle performance optimization in your application?

//answer: Talk about techniques such as lazy loading, code splitting, memoization, and database indexing.

// Performance Optimization Strategies

// I've used several optimization techniques in my project. For instance,
// I leveraged caching, load balancing, and bundling. With Next.js, I created 
// an image component using its built-in optimization feature, which automatically
// sets the height and width, and used dynamic imports to load components only when 
// needed, reducing initial load times. I also utilized static generation (getStaticProps)
// and server-side rendering (getServerSideProps) to pre-render pages, speeding up client-side rendering.
// On the backend, I ensured all I/O operations were non-blocking with asynchronous methods (promises, async/await)
// and streamlined middleware to reduce request processing time.In MongoDB,I designed efficient
// schemas, optimized queries to enhance database operations.

// Note---
//  in node we can also use Compression, Clustering for optiming our application 
// in mongodb  we can use indexes and connection polling

// -----Example Scenario
// For instance, in your interview app:

// Page Load Speed: Utilize Next.js static generation for pages like the home page or interview list to deliver content faster.
// Database Queries: Index the questions collection on fields like category and difficulty to speed up query responses when filtering questions.
// API Response Time: Implement Redis for caching frequent API responses, reducing the need to hit the database for every request.
// Efficient Code: Apply dynamic imports to load heavy components like video interview feedback only when the user navigates to that specific page.


// Advanced Topics
// How would you scale interviewApp to handle a growing number of users?

//answer: Discuss strategies for scaling the frontend, backend, and database, including load balancing and microservices.

// What would you do differently if you were to start the project from scratch?

// Reflect on the lessons learned and improvements you would make in terms of architecture, technology choices, or development processes.
// Behavioral Questions
// How do you keep up with the latest developments in web technologies?
// Share your approach to continuous learning, such as following industry blogs, participating in online courses, or attending conferences.
// By preparing answers for these questions, you'll be well-equipped to discuss your interviewApp
